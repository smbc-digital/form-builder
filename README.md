# Providers
## Address Providers

`IAddressProvider` is provided to enable integration with different address data sources. 

The interface requires a ProviderName and a SearchAsync method which must return an `AddressSearchResult` object. 

```c#
string ProviderName { get; }

Task<IEnumerable<AddressSearchResult>> SearchAsync(string streetOrPostcode);
```

You can register new/multiple address providers in startup 

```c#
services.AddSingleton<IAddressProvider, FakeAddressProvider>();
services.AddSingleton<IAddressProvider, CRMAddressProvider>();
services.AddSingleton<IAddressProvider, MyCustomAddressProvider>();
```

You can specify in the JSON form defenition for Address elements, which address provider you want use. To do this set `AddressProvider` to the value of the required `IAddressProvider.ProviderName`, for example to use a Provider with a ProviderName of "Fake";

```json
{
  "Type": "Address",
  "Properties": {
    "QuestionId": "address",
    "AddressProvider": "Fake",
  }
}
```

## Street Providers

`IStreetProvider` is provided to enable integration with different street level data sources. 

Implementation is almost identical to that described in the AddressProvider

Register for use 

```c#
services.AddSingleton<IStreetProvider, FakeStreetProvider>();
services.AddSingleton<IStreetProvider, CRMStreetProvider>();
return services;
```

Specify which street provider to use.

```json
"Elements": [
  {
    "Type": "Street",
    "Properties": {
      "QuestionId": "customersstreet",
      "StreetProvider": "Fake",
    }
```


## Organisation Providers

`IOrganisationProvider` is provided to enable integration with different organisation data sources. 

Implementation is almost identical to that described in the AddressProvider/StreetProvider, however Organisation Providers return an `OrganisationSearchResult`

Register for user

```c#
services.AddSingleton<IOrganisationProvider, FakeOrganisationProvider>();
services.AddSingleton<IOrganisationProvider, CRMOrganisationProvider>();
return services;
```

Specify which organisation provider to use.

```json
{
  "Type": "Organisation",
  "Properties": {
    "QuestionId": "organisation",
    "Label": "Enter the organisation",
    "OrganisationProvider": "Fake",
  }
```
## Payment Providers

## Storage Providers

As users submit data and move through forms the data they are submitting is temporarily stored before submission.

This function uses [IDistributedCache](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/performance/caching/distributed?view=aspnetcore-3.1).

Storage providers can be added from config and registered on app startup using.

```c#
services.AddStorageProvider(Configuration);
```

### Application
By default setup using config currently supports "Application", Distributed In Memory Cache (which ironically isn't actually distributed!), but allows us to develop locally and deploy to single instances.

This can be set up using the following config

```json
  {
    "StorageProvider": {
      "Type": "Application"
    }
  }
```

### Redis
For a truly distributed we support Redis, this can be setup using the StorageProvider config below.

```json
{
  "StorageProvider": {
      "Type": "Redis",
      "Address": "YourRedisUrlHere",
      "Instance": "YourPreferredInstanceNameHere"
  }
}
```

### Running High Availability/Load Balancing
If running in a load balanced environment you will need to be running a truly distributed cache (i.e. Redis).

In this case it's worth noting that for sessions to work correctly there needs to be a shared keystore.

Distributed cache and DataProtecton key storage specification is wrapped up in the ```services.AddStorageProvider(Configuration);``` service registration (we should seperate this out!) so when you set storage provider to 'Redis' it also shares the data protection keys in redis as well (as per the code below).

```c#
  var redis = ConnectionMultiplexer.Connect(storageProviderConfiguration["Address"]);
  services.AddDataProtection().PersistKeysToStackExchangeRedis(redis, $"{storageProviderConfiguration["InstanceName"]}DataProtection-Keys");
```

# UI Tests

The form builder app has UI tests to ensure that the UI is expected. Our UI Tests are written using SpecFlow

### Requirements
- chromdrivers.exe
- make (not required)

### How to run UI tests locally

```console
$ make ui-test
```

It is also possible to run just a specific test case rather then running the whole ui-test suite, this is made possible by running the `ui-test-feature` make command. with a FEATURE paramater as the test suite to run. The example below runs only the organisation ui-tests.
```console
$ make FEATURE=organisation ui-test-feature
```

without make you can also run the UI Test locally by running the two commands listed below

```console
$ cd ./src && dotnet run
```
```console
$ dotnet test ./form-builder-tests-ui/form-builder-tests-ui.csproj
```

It is possible to change the default browser the UI Tests are run from, to do this you need to modify the BrowserConfiguration to run with firefox or another browser of your choice.

# AWS Architecture Decisions #
This section will be used to document the decisions made throughout the development process.

## Form Builder Storage Stack
The formbuilder storage components will be provisioned by a Cloudformation stack. Jon H & Jake decided that the stack would include an S3 Bucket, IAM User and a User Policy to handle the storage of json files. 

### IAM User Policy Example
The example below shows the policy we manually created and applied to a test user:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutAccountPublicAccessBlock",
                "s3:GetAccountPublicAccessBlock",
                "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
                "s3:ListJobs",
                "s3:CreateJob",
                "s3:HeadBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "s3:*",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::bucketname/*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::bucketname"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
## FormBuilder Bucket Config
The S3 bucket used during testing was cofigured to 'Block all public access' to 'On'.

The bucket will be created using a Cloudformation template with the folder structure created by the template.
